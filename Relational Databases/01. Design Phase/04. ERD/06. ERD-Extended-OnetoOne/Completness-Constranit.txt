Partial Completness
===================
Tells us that it is not necessary for the super-type table to have a record
in any sub-type table, you could have a record in the super-type table
without a record in any sub-type table. That is, it is optional for the
supertype to have a record in any of the subtypes.

Total Completness
=================
Tells us that for every record in the super-type table, we must have a
record in any of the sub-type tables. That is, it is mandatory for the
supertype to have a subtype.

The letter 'd'
==============
'd' stands for Disjoint Subtypes/Nonoverlapping Subtypes; that is, it is
Optional/Mandatory for a record in the supertype to have a record in a
subtype but in one and only one subtype.

The letter 'o'
==============
'o' stands for Overlapping Subtypes; that is, it is Optional/Mandatory for
a record in the supertype to have a record in more than one subtype.
