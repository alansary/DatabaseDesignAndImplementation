- Whenever you represent a relationship between two strong entities, use
  dashed lines, otherwise, use solid lines.
- The dashed line between strong entities represen weak relationship, each
  of the strong tables is stand-alone table, they are independent, dropping
  any one of them will end the relationship immediately (One to Many).
- The solid line between a strong entity and a weak entity represent a
  strong relationship, the weak entity can not stand by it self, if we
  dropped the strong entity, there is no need for the weak entity any more.
  The relationship here is strong because the weak entity is strongly
  dependen on the strong entity.

- Strong Entity ----------- Strong Entity
- Weak Entity ___________ Strong Entity
