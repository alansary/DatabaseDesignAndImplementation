Where to start creating your database?
======================================
    Database Management System? False
    Pen and Paper? True

Database Design and Implementation
==================================
Database Development is Broken into Two Phases:
    1. Design/Logical
    2. Implementation/Physical

Design Phase
============
Entity: An object with distinct and independent existance.
Attribute: Characteristics that allows us to identify the entity among
           the other entities.
Domains: characters/numeric/...

Example
=======
Entity: Employee
Attributes: Name, SSN, Profession, Salary, Hire Date
Domains: VARCHAR, INTEGER, VARCHAR, FLOAT, DATE

Entity: Patient
Attributes: Name, Health Card ID, Address, Phone
Domains: VARCHAR, INTEGER, TEXT, CHAR

How to Define Entities?
=======================
Through a problem statement
Ahmed, the owner of XYZ company, wants a customer management system that
allows sales employees to (store) the following (customers data):
(name, email, phone, address, age, birth date, credit card number, and
register date.)

    - Look for keywords
    - (store) is an indecation that we need a database.
    - Store what? (customers data)
      - What kind of customer data we are looking for?
        name, address, etc

Entity: Customer
Attributes: Name, Email, Phone, Address, Age, Birth Date, Credit Card no.,
            and Register Date

Implementation Phase
====================
Table
    Customer
Columns (Fields)
    Name: Mohamed Amr Alansary
    Email: mohamed_alansary@rocketmail.com
    Phone: +20-1207395400
    Address: Flat 105, Floor 3, Entrance 3, Building 2.
    Age: 24
    Birth Date: 10 Jan, 1993
    Credit Card no: 4519000000
    Register Date: 10 Oct, 2011
Values are Records (Rows)

Walk-through
============
Desktop Application - Mobile Application - Web Application

Why Design Phase?
=================
    Eliminate anomalies
     - When you want to delete something and end up deleting other things
       unexpectedly
     -> Insertion Anomaly
     -> Deletion Anomaly
     -> Update Anomaly
    Eliminate unnecessary redundancy
    Design phase allows you to:
     - Maintain consistency
     - Maintain accuracy

Note
====
Logical phase == Modeling phase == Design phase
Physical phase == Implementation phase
