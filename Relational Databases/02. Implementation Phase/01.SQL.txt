What is SQL?
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a collection of keywords to control/
handle data in a database.

What does query mean?
It means requesting or inquiring something, so basically we use the
collection of keywords (commands) to request data from databases and
these keywords have to be written in a specific and structured way. Hence,
the abbreviation SQL has the term "Structured".

Procedural vs. Descriptive languages:
  - Procedural languages like C specifies what data is requested and how
    to get those data.
  - Descriptive languages like SQL specifies what data is requested without
    even caring about how to get those data.

What is the definition of a language?
The Set of strings over the alphabet of the language. It consists of the use
of words in a structured and conventional way. It has a specific syntax and
semantics.
