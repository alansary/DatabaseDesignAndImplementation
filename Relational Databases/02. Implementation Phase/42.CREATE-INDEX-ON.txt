    Index = A quick lookup table for finding things you need to search for
            frequently. Indexes are fast because they don't have to carry
            all the data of a row in the table. Primary key is an index by
            default. You can use an additional INDEX using INDEX(col_name)
            in your table definition. Use INDEX whenever you want to use
            it in JOIN frequently.
