Date Types
==========
DATE                    Date only, stores DATE values from the year 1000
                        to 9999
			YYYY-MM-DD
TIME                    Time only, has range of +-840 hours
			HH:MM:SS OR HH:MM:SS.FF
DATETIME                Date and time
TIMESTAMP               Just like DATETIME but with few important
                        distinctions, specifically designed to keep time
                        for events and stored in GMT, they are converted to
                        and from local time (the time on the server which
                        may be differ than the time on the user)

SELECT CURDATE() AS 'Current Date', CURTIME() AS 'Current Time', NOW() AS 'Time Now';
SELECT NOW(), DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 2 WEEK) AS Later;
SELECT NOW(), DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 2 DAY) AS Later;
SELECT NOW(), DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 2 MONTH) AS Later;
SELECT NOW(), DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 2 YEAR) AS Later;
SELECT NOW(), DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 2 WEEK) AS Earlier;
SELECT NOW(), DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 2 DAY) AS Earlier;
SELECT NOW(), DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 2 MONTH) AS Earlier;
SELECT NOW(), DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 2 YEAR) AS Earlier;
