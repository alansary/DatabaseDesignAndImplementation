SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE EXISTS(SELECT first_name, last_name FROM job_history WHERE employees_id = employees.employees_id);

%Same effect can be obtained by
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employees_id IN(SELECT employees_id FROM job_history GROUP BY employees_id);
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employees_id IN(SELECT employees_id FROM job_history);
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employees_id IN(SELECT DISTINCT employees_id FROM job_history);
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employees_id NOT IN(SELECT DISTINCT employees_id FROM job_history);
