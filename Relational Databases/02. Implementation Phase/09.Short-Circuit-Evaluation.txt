	- If we have multiple AND operators, start with the condition that
	  is most likely be evaluated to FALSE. (Holds for SQL since it
	  violates the over all condition, nothing to grap).
	- If we have multipl OR operators, start with the condition that is
	  most likely be evaluated to TRUE. (Doesn't hold for SQL since we
	  grap results according to each condition).
