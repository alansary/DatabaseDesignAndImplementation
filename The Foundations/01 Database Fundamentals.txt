Transactions and the ACID test
	Transaction is defined as a compound unit of work, either all happens or neither of them do.
	The previous changes would be reversed by the database if any part of the transaction fails.
	A transaction must be:
		Atomic: Completely happens or not at all (All or nothing rule).
		Consistent: Take the database from one valid state to another valid state based on the rules of the database.
		Isolated: Lock the data until the transaction is correct.
		Durable: If the transaction is initiated and then something bad happens, this transaction must occur after the problem has been fixed.
